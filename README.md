# Citibike Analysis

## Overview
For this project we had to analyze data and transform it into visual aids that can better represent this data through Tableau. The data was obtained from the CitiBike program website.

## Data Process
The data was downloaded from the Citibike program in a CSV file. The only changes we had to make to the file were changing a column type for the trip duration. Once this was complete, the data was exported to Tableau public. 

## Results

I had a lot of issues with trying to save the workbook in a form where I could use it independantly of Tableau. I tried to convert the visualizations to JPG but it wouldnt work and when I tried other methods it would start giving me an error with the datasheet. Eventually I gave up and decided I would just post the link to the Tableau workspace here.

## Summary
The program is pretty dominated by its male users which isnt necessarily a bad thing but I feel that their businees would perform even better if they could some how appeal to female users more.
